# My Personal Developer Portfolio

My personal portfolio website built from scratch with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (v4), and Motion. Features a fully responsive, animated, single-page application (SPA) design with a dynamic "glassmorphism" UI.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## ✨ Features

- Single Page Application (SPA): All content (Home, Summary, Skills) is dynamically rendered inside a single, persistent "glass" card, with views managed by React state.

- Animated Background: A persistent glow element that smoothly animates to different positions for each view, built with pure CSS transitions.

- Glassmorphism UI: A modern, frosted-glass effect for the main card, navigation, and modal elements.

- Interactive Modals: Animated modals (built with motion/react) for the "Summary" section to display professional and academic history.

- Fully Responsive: A full mobile-first optimization pass for all components and views, from the navigation to the content.

- Custom Loader: A branded skeleton loader that plays on the initial site visit.

- Functional Contact Form: Integrated with a client-side Web3Forms hook to send emails directly from the site.
